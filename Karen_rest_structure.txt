My husband Rand and I like to come here every few weeks for date night. This past Friday, we came here to celebrate our 21st anniversary. Rand and I have been feeling blue lately because there is no football on TV, and because I can’t go to the nail salon. We were hoping that a romantic date would help cheer us up. When we came in, we noticed that all of the servers were wearing masks, and all the windows were open. When the hostess came over to greet us, Rand said, “I hope you don’t expect me to wear a mask!” The hostess just said, “OK.” No sense of humor at all! It was a little rude. Well, we sat down in our usual spot, and because the windows were open, our napkins kept blowing off the table! Plus, the music was also way too loud. When we asked the waitress to close the windows and turn the music down, she said OK. But then we had to wait 5-7 minutes before someone came back and closed the window. Rand was about to get up and do it himself! The people who work here are pretty lazy. We ordered a Barefoot Chardonnay for me, a Bud Light for Rand, and mozzarella sticks (non-spicy). The wine and beer were good, but our mozzarella sticks were way too spicy. We only tip for great service, so we didn’t feel the need to leave a tip. On the way out, we overheard the waitress insulting my haircut. We won’t be coming back.
