## Usage
[@KarenVsManager](https://twitter.com/KarenVsManager)

#### Random numbers generated by random.randint select one of three options:
* Posting a complaint about a restaurant/retail store
* Retweeting from a twitter account
* Sharing a random recipe

#### Complaints
The module Markovify generates novel text based on two text samples. The first is text scraped from one star Yelp reviews. The second is a written sample to provide more structure to the Yelp review model. The model created by Markovify combines both of these texts. A random chain and hashtag are included in the tweet. 

#### Retweets
A twitter account is retweeted from a selected list of twitter accounts. 

#### Recipes
BeautifulSoup is used to scrape html links from allrecipes.com. Random.randint selects one of the recipes that includes "ranch", "bacon", or "potato salad" as an ingredient.
