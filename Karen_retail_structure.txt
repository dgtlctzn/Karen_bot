If I could, I would give this store zero stars. The customer service here is absolutely terrible. This afternoon, I came here to buy lavender scented bath bombs and a rug for my daughter’s room. I had a hard time finding the bath bombs, and no one offered to help me. Then, they were all sold out of blue rugs, so I had to get a pink one. When I went up to pay, the lady at the counter said she couldn’t accept my coupons, because they were “expired”! I told her the commercials say that these coupons never expire. “Too bad,” she said. “They’re expired.” I told her that she shouldn’t work in customer service with that type of attitude. Then she just rolled her eyes at me. I said I would like to speak to her supervisor, and she said SHE was the store manager! What kind of a store has a manager like that? I have never felt so disrespected in my life. I told her I was going to call the cops and she just said, “Fine.” I am thoroughly disappointed. I will be filing a complaint.
